We've taken out all of the stuff you don't need (bloated code, JavaScript overload, force-fed CSS frameworks...you get the idea), and created a framework, /motif, that makes custom template development a breeze for web designers.


==About /motif==

/motif is a template development framework for Joomla! built to simplify the development of fully-custom Joomla! templates and empower web designers to become Joomla! template developers. We are Joomla! template designers and developers, and we built /motif in October 2009 to "scratch our own itch." We needed a simple, robust, and flexible template framework with a non-restrictive license so we could use it on all of the custom templates we build for our clients. Unfortunately, none of the frameworks available at the time quite fit what we needed, so we built our own.
